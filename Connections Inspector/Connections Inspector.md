 # **Connections Inspector**

#### *The Connections Inspector is a tool in Xcode's Interface Builder that lets you manage the connections between user interface elements (such as buttons, labels, and views) and the code that controls their behavior. Specifically, the Connections Inspector allows you to create and manage the following types of connections:*

- `Outlets:` These are properties in your view controller's code file that provide a reference to a user interface element. You can use outlets to access and modify the properties of a user interface element programmatically (e.g., changing the text of a label, hiding or showing a view, etc.). To create an outlet, you control-drag from the user interface element to your code file.

- `Actions:` These are methods in your view controller's code file that are triggered by user interaction with a user interface element (such as tapping a button or swiping a table view cell). You can use actions to respond to user input and update the state of your app (e.g., updating a label's text, navigating to a new screen, etc.). To create an action, you control-drag from the user interface element to your code file.

- `Segues:` These are transitions between view controllers that define the flow of your app's user interface. You can use segues to specify how a user interface element (such as a button) should transition to a new screen or view controller. To create a segue, you control-drag from the user interface element to the target view controller.

- `Delegates:` These are objects that handle events and respond to changes in your app's state. You can use delegates to customize the behavior of user interface elements and respond to user input in a fine-grained way (e.g., responding to changes in the text of a text field, implementing custom behavior for table view cells, etc.). To set a delegate, you select the user interface element and choose the appropriate delegate from the Connections Inspector's dropdown menu.

###### *The Connections Inspector provides a convenient way to manage these connections and keep your app's user interface and behavior in sync with your code. By using outlets, actions, segues, and delegates, you can create a rich, responsive user interface that provides a great user experience.*
